## The Knowledge Gap

Starting your first job in tech is hard.

There are a bunch of reasons for this but I think that for the most part it comes down to the fact that there's a crazy amount of things that you need to learn all at once. Or at the very least, you feel like you have to learn them all at once, as you're constantly bombarded with dozens of terms that you've never heard of before.

If you start in a web developer position without knowing anything about the web, like myself, then odds are you'll be spending a lot of time just trying to understand the platform that you're going to be writing code for, let alone understanding the framework your team uses.

Then, on top of technology, there's probably going to be a lot of weird tribal knowledge and maybe product or company specific knowledge (stuff that should be documented but let's face it, probably isn't). This stuff can even be harder than learning the tech because if it isn't well documented, it can really only be gained through time, experience and conversation.

So, you have many, many things to learn when you start your first job, and it's all going to take a lot of brain power. This won't come as a news flash to anyone who's had to go through this alredy but having all of these things bouncing around in your head can be overwhelming, to say the least. My first job in the industry was as a summer intern, working on a React project. I came in with a base level understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but I felt completely out of my depth.

This isn't a particularly unique feeling amongst new devs. Another thing that I've noticed that many of use have in common is that we want to overcome this barrier as quickly as possible. I was very optimistic, and despite my lack of knoweldge, I desperately wanted to prove myself to my team and have an impact on the codebase.

## The Emotions

Wanting to have an impact is grat and all but I quickly realized that doing so in the way that I was imagining was going to be a huge challenge. It's pretty hard to make an impact on the code when you know almost nothing about the tech stack that you're working with.

For a good portion of my internship, I would come into work every day, sit down, look at our JIRA board and immediately become stressed by the amount of work that I knew I wouldn't be able to comlpete by myself. For some sprints, I wouldn't know how to do a single thing.

So, in order to get any work done, I would have to pair with somebody else on the team, which felt a little deflating to me. I knew that it was expected considering my background, but I didn't like the feeling of being so reliant on everyone else.

Meetings were also painful in their own way. For me, they usually involved a constant flood of terms and information that I didn't understand. Most meetings took me a long time to be able to contribute to beyond asking questions. I tried to ask questions as much as I could, but I often felt awkward doing this in meetings, especially ones that weren't part of a regular scrum ceremony rotation.

I would feel this reluctance because I would often lack so much context for a particular conversation that any quesiton I could've forumulated at the time would've completely derailed the meeting. For example, if a certain technology was brought up during the meeting that I wasn't aware of, I probably wouldn't ask about it.

Why bother? It's not like someone is going to be able to explain a technology like Jenkins or Kubernetes to me in the middle of a meeting. Any response they would give me would probably lead to five more questions.

Over time, all of this stuff began to pile on, and I became really bothered. I felt like I was a complete burden to my team. From my perspective, I was just absorbing knowledge and resources from my team on a daily basis without providing anything truly useful in return.

I wasn't helping anyone else solve their problems, I wasn't going and making big changes to the code, so what was I really doing? I hated this feeling. I didn't like not knowing things and I wanted to help others, not be helped myself. I wanted to make an imapct on something big, something visible that would prove to me that I had a real value.

## The Plan

The one positive thing that stemmed from feeling like a walking resource sink is that I became incredibly motivated to make sure that I was the opposite. Unfortunately, I put a lot of my energy in the wrong place. Instead of accepting my lack of knowledge and attempting to be a good teammate regardless, I resented it and attempted to fight back, to be what I was not.

I wanted to make a code contribution, something that I thought would tangibly prove that the resources that my team was sinking into me were resources well spent.

Now, this wasn't a bad idea on its face. I think that being motivated to make important code contributions is good thing and everyone should strive to do so at some point. I, however, was impatient. I was on a schedule.

I was an intern, so I only had three months to make that big contribution I wanted to badly. Take yourself through that for a second. How was I, a developer that had almost zero prior experience writing React applications, supposed to make a truly significant, large-scale code contribution within the span of three months?

The answer may surprise you, but there actually was a way for me to make a significant contribution, and I did make one towards the end of my internship. The problem was that it just wasn't very good.

Basically, I decided that instead of making the smart long term decision to spend my time hunkering down and learning as much about the fundementals of the web and React as I could, I would pick one topic to become an 'expert' on so that I could be productive when it came to working in that particular area.

During my internship, I decided that Redux was going to be the thing that I would spend my time getting really familiar with. React just seemed like such a behemoth to me at the time, and three months just wasn't enough time for me to get to a level where I could make big dents in the code. Redux, on the other hand, only has a couple of key concepts, and was used everywhere throughout our code. It felt just as important as React and appeared to be way easier to learn, so I went for it.

## The Result

Without realizing it, I had made a pretty serious tradeoff. I was essentially saying that I was willing to forgoe the long term gains that I would recieve from learning the fundementals and in return, I would gain a boost to my productivity in the short term.

If you had asked me what I felt about this tradeoff at the time, I would've told you that I was making the right call given the situation that I was in as an intern. Looking back on it now, I'm certain that I was on the bad end of that trade, and there are a couple of reasons that I feel this way.

That productivity worked really well for me in the context of that internship. I got a lot of work done that summer, and I pushed a lot of code into production. For that most part, that code was actually pretty good. I'm proud of most of the code that I pushed out last summer.

Unfortunately though, there was some code that I pushed out last summer that I now cringe to think about. I'm sure that this isn't a novel feeling. If I was to go around and take a survey of developers out there, most would say that they've felt the same at some point.

But, remember when I said before that I did end up making a significant code contribution? THAT was the bit of code that I look back on and cringe at. The code that ended up leaving the biggest mark on the codebase is the code that I believe to be the lowest quality of anything that I wrote that summer.

While that's unfortunate in it of itself, I think that what was worse is that I made the decision that benefitted me in the short term, without thinking about my future beyond the internship.

My lack of focus on the fundementals meant that it would actually take longer for me to get to the point in my career that I really wanted to be at. Being able to make those big, high quality contributions and partake in architectural discussion requires, at the bare minimum, an adept understanding of the fundementals, and I just wasn't focusing on it.

It wasn't until after I left my job and took a real, deep dive into React that I gained enough knowledge to feel confident that I could at least make minor contributions to those kinds of conversations.

## The Revelation

Unfortunately, by that point, that knowledge wasn't useful to anyone (besides myself) because the internship was over and I was back at school. Getting the chance to take a break from work was really beneficially for me. I didn't really take any time to reflect during my time as an intern. I was so consumed by actually doing work and trying to get things done, that I never really took the time to just chill and think.

I mean who knows, if I didn't have a full gap year between my internship and starting full time, I probably would've had to learn the things that I'm articulating in this article the hard way, through some major mistake, rather than through reflection.

So what exactly did I reflect on during my time at school that enabled me to write this post? There were a lot of things, but the most important thing that I began to think about a lot was a point that both my mentor and manager had made to me during my internship. I was just too busy being in my own head to listen to them, but it was easily one of the most valuable things that they expressed to me, whenever I would let them in on some of the more negative thoughts I was having.

They told me that **junior developers, like senior developers, have inherent value**.

It's just different and more subtle than than the value of senior developers. That doesn't make it any less important, though. Senior developers provide a value that is very out there, very in your face. They make big, architectural decisions that affect an entire project, they have some in depth technical knowledge that they share with another team to help out their project, they make big code contributions that make a project noticeably better. I could go on, but I think you get the point. Senior developers have an obvious value.

Junior developers value comes from the nature of who they are rather than the extent of their technical knowledge. Junior developers provide value by partaking in the team building and knowledge sharing processes of a team. They keep a team flexible by bringing on a fresh perspective and encourage the team to be better by their mere presence and engagement. Now, that all may seem a little less exciting depending on what you're into (I know it was for me at first), but I would argue that these contributions are just as important as the technical ones.

If you find yourself not unconvinced, allow me to attempt to persuade you by further discussing the virtues of junior developers, and hopefully demonstrating how they seem to be so well disposed to participating in the process of team growth.

## The Perspective

I think that the most valuable thing that a junior developer can do is to show up, be engaged and be yourself. That's it. That may not sound like much, but the things that happen when they're engaged can be truly benficial to the team and the project they're working on as a whole.

The biggest thing that junior devs can bring to the table when they're engaged is a fresh perspective. When you're in any industry for a significant period of time, it's pretty easy to get cynical. I actually think that cynicism is particularly valuable in software, but it can become a problem if cynicism is the ubiquitous mindset on a team. Juniors haven't accumulated enough experience or baggage to become cynical, and will often have a sense of optimism (some might call naevity) that probably isn't shared by many others outside of their shoes. Maybe that optimism or naeiveity isn't valuable in it of itself, but it's very valuable when it comes to bringing ideological balance to a team.

Not only that, but that kind of optimism brings a certain level of flexibility to a team. It's super easy to waste the time of a senior developer. If they do some piece of work and it doesn't pan out as anticipated, a senior developer could easily turn around and say that their time could have been better spent elsewhere. This creates an aversion to experimental and potentially nebulous pieces of work. Junior devs don't have this problem. It's incredibly hard to waste the time of a Junior developer, so putting them to work on stuff that's a little bit more risky is a win-win situation for the team. Worst case scenario, the junior dev will have a positive learning experience. Best case scenario, something new and different will get brought into the team or project, something that probalby wouldn't have made it in if you didn't have a junior dev there to do that work. That right there is enough to make junior devs valuable.

## The Status Quo

Junior devs are also in a pretty unique position to be able to challenge the status quo of the team that they join. The obvious reason for this is that the status quo doesn't apply for them because well, they're new. Not only are they new to the team, but they're new to everything, which makes them doubly effective at this.

Often, one of the big ways that the status quo can get challenged on the team is by people going around and asking, Why? Asking why is dangerous, because sometimes, there isn't a very good answer. This is conjecture on my part, but I'm willing to be that most teams are doing something that is inoptimal. Whether it's in code or in process, there's always something that we can be doing better. Now, there are a couple of reasons for this. The first is that the team just isn't aware that they're doing something inoptimal. This is kind of assuming the worst though, and when the why question is asked in a way that makes this assumption, the person asking probably won't make many friends (so don't do that).

The alternative, which I've found is the case most of the time (in my five months of being in the industry), is that the work to make things optimal just isn't prioritized very often. You do some work to get a feature out there, and to make it work you had to cut some corners. The team knows there's a better way to do things, but the feature is out there, so the work needed to fix it will get moved to the back burner in favor of new features. Once people get used to working around the fact that this feature wasn't implemented in the best way possible, the work to fix it will become even less important than it aleady was.

So basically, as long as the person asking isn't being an ass about it, asking the why question can bring some much needed attention to the decisions that led to an inoptimal process or piece of code. It can also be useful in determining if any logical decision making went on at all. Maybe the answer is nebulous, the person being asked the why question gives an answer like "Well, that's just how things have always been done." As I write out that sentence, I now realize that I've said this to a new hire within the last week, so it definetily happens and when it does, that's probably an indication that something is up.

Junior developers aren't the only ones that can challenge the status quo this way, anyone can really. New hires are also people that are in a great position to do this kind of thing. But, Junior developers are probably going to be asking more questions than anyone else, and I think that that makes them particularly good at this.

## The Code Review

Having junior devs do code review is win-win situation. Worst case scenario, the junior dev doing the review asks a bunch of questions about what's going on and get's them answered. Great, they get to learn some new things. Best case scenario, they end up making the codebase significantly more maintainable.

Maintainability is obviously very important in any codebase. I think that code complexity is one of the biggest blockers to a codebase being easily maintable. If they're bold enough, junior devs can be a great check to code complexity by inserting themselves into the review process. Over-engineering is thing, and if a piece of code flies over the head of a junior dev that has inserted themselves into the review process, that code is probably not going to make it into the codebase without being simplified. Because by inserting themselves, the junior dev has basically created a bar of complexity that the code is allowed to reach.

This can obviously be abused, but as long as the junior devs in question aren't arrogant and block anything that they don't understand, they can be a great tool to keep things simple and readable.

By keeping your code simple enough for your junior devs to understand, not only are you doing them a favor, you're doing a favor to everyone on your team. In fact, it's even more than that. Projects and teams are fluid over time and maybe one day, some other team be working in your codebase. Would that team rather be reading through code that only senior developers could understand, or would they rather be reading through code that a junior dev could understand? My money is on the latter.

## The Conclusion

So, what I've been trying to say throughout all of this, in a very long-winded way, is that junior developers matter. I didn't recognize this during my first couple of months as a junior developer, and ultimately I and my team was worse off for it. If a junior developer can embrace their role rather than resent it, they will ultimately be able to act as a building block that the rest of their team can build themselves around. Then, in a year or two, once everything is beginning to settle down, maybe another new dev will join the team, and cycle will continue. The team will continue to grow, the new developers will grow and the entire industry will prosper as a result.

So, if you're a junior dev (or about to be one), don't get in your head, and understand that you bring something truly valuable to the table. If you're a senior, make sure that your juniors hear it from you, I'm sure it'll be far more meaningful coming from you than another junior dev on the internet.
