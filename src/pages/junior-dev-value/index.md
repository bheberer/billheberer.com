## The Knowledge Gap

Starting your first job in tech is hard.

There are a bunch of reasons for this but I think that for the most part it comes down to the fact that there's a crazy amount of things that you need to learn all at once. Or at the very least, you feel like you have to learn them all at once, as you're constantly bombarded with dozens of terms that you've never heard of before.

If you start in a web developer position without knowing anything about the web, like myself, then odds are you'll be spending a lot of time just trying to understand the platform that you're going to be writing code for, let alone understanding the framework your team uses.

Then, on top of technology, there's probably going to be a lot of weird tribal knowledge and maybe product or company specific knowledge (stuff that should be documented but let's face it, probably isn't). This stuff can even be harder than learning the tech because if it isn't well documented, it can really only be gained through time, experience and conversation.

So, you have many, many things to learn when you start your first job, and it's all going to take a lot of brain power. This won't come as a news flash to anyone who's had to go through this alredy but having all of these things bouncing around in your head can be overwhelming, to say the least. My first job in the industry was as a summer intern, working on a React project. I came in with a base level understanding of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but I felt completely out of my depth.

This isn't a particularly unique feeling amongst new devs. Another thing that I've noticed that many of use have in common is that we want to overcome this barrier as quickly as possible. I was very optimistic, and despite my lack of knoweldge, I desperately wanted to prove myself to my team and have an impact on the codebase.

## The Emotions

Wanting to have an impact is grat and all but I quickly realized that doing so in the way that I was imagining was going to be a huge challenge. It's pretty hard to make an impact on the code when you know almost nothing about the tech stack that you're working with.

For a good portion of my internship, I would come into work every day, sit down, look at our JIRA board and immediately become stressed by the amount of work that I knew I wouldn't be able to comlpete by myself. For some sprints, I wouldn't know how to do a single thing.

So, in order to get any work done, I would have to pair with somebody else on the team, which felt a little deflating to me. I knew that it was expected considering my background, but I didn't like the feeling of being so reliant on everyone else.

Meetings were also painful in their own way. For me, they usually involved a constant flood of terms and information that I didn't understand. Most meetings took me a long time to be able to contribute to beyond asking questions. I tried to ask questions as much as I could, but I often felt awkward doing this in meetings, especially ones that weren't part of a regular scrum ceremony rotation.

I would feel this reluctance because I would often lack so much context for a particular conversation that any quesiton I could've forumulated at the time would've completely derailed the meeting. For example, if a certain technology was brought up during the meeting that I wasn't aware of, I probably wouldn't ask about it.

Why bother? It's not like someone is going to be able to explain a technology like Jenkins or Kubernetes to me in the middle of a meeting. Any response they would give me would probably lead to five more questions.

Over time, all of this stuff began to pile on, and I became really bothered. I felt like I was a complete burden to my team. From my perspective, I was just absorbing knowledge and resources from my team on a daily basis without providing anything truly useful in return.

I wasn't helping anyone else solve their problems, I wasn't going and making big changes to the code, so what was I really doing? I hated this feeling. I didn't like not knowing things and I wanted to help others, not be helped myself. I wanted to make an imapct on something big, something visible that would prove to me that I had a real value.

## The Plan

The one positive thing that stemmed from feeling like a walking resource sink is that I became incredibly motivated to make sure that I was the opposite. Unfortunately, I put a lot of my energy in the wrong place. Instead of accepting my lack of knowledge and attempting to be a good teammate regardless, I resented it and attempted to fight back.

I wanted to make a code contribution, something that I thought would tangibly prove that the resources that my team was sinking into me were resources well spent.

Now, this wasn't a bad idea on its face. I think that being motivated to make important code contributions is good thing and everyone should strive to do so at some point. I, however, was impatient. I was on a schedule.

I was an intern, so I only had three months to make that big contribution I wanted to badly. Take yourself through that for a second. How was I, a developer that had almost zero prior experience writing React applications, supposed to make a truly significant, large-scale code contribution within the span of three months?

The answer may surprise you, but there actually was a way for me to make a significant contribution, and I did make one towards the end of my internship. The problem was that it just wasn't very good.

Basically, I decided that instead of making the smart long term decision to spend my time hunkering down and learning as much about the fundementals of the web and React as I could, I would pick one topic to become an 'expert' on so that I could be productive when it came to working in that particular area.

During my internship, I decided that Redux was going to be the thing that I would spend my time getting really familiar with. React just seemed like such a behemoth to me at the time, and three months just wasn't enough time for me to get to a level where I could make big dents in the code. Redux, on the other hand, only has a couple of key concepts, and was used everywhere throughout our code. It felt just as important as React and appeared to be way easier to learn, so I went for it.

## The Result

Without realizing it, I had made a pretty serious tradeoff. I was essentially saying that I was willing to forgoe the long term gains that I would recieve from learning the fundementals and in return, I would gain a boost to my productivity in the short term.

If you had asked me what I felt about this tradeoff at the time, I would've told you that I was making the right call given the situation that I was in as an intern. Looking back on it now, I'm certain that I was on the bad end of that trade, and there are a couple of reasons that I feel this way.

That productivity worked really well for me in the context of that internship. I got a lot of work done that summer, and I pushed a lot of code into production. For that most part, that code was actually pretty good. I'm proud of most of the code that I pushed out last summer.

Unfortunately though, there was some code that I pushed out last summer that I now cringe to think about. I'm sure that this isn't a novel feeling. If I was to go around and take a survey of developers out there, most would say that they've felt the same at some point.

But, remember when I said before that I did end up making a significant code contribution? THAT was the bit of code that I look back on and cringe at. The code that ended up leaving the biggest mark on the codebase is the code that I believe to be the lowest quality of anything that I wrote that summer.

While that's unfortunate in it of itself, I think that what was worse is that I made the decision that benefitted me in the short term, without thinking about my future beyond the internship.

My lack of focus on the fundementals meant that it would actually take longer for me to get to the point in my career that I really wanted to be at. Being able to make those big, high quality contributions and partake in architectural discussion requires, at the bare minimum, an adept understanding of the fundementals, and I just wasn't focusing on it.

It wasn't until after I left my job and took a real, deep dive into React that I gained enough knowledge to feel confident that I could at least make minor contributions to those kinds of conversations.

## The Revelation

After I left my internship to head back to school, I finally began to reflect on what I had done. Ideally, I would be thinking about what I was doing as I was doing it, but I was so focused on getting stuff done that I didn't really take the time to do that.

It was during this year of school that I began to understand and be able to articulate all of the things that I've shared in this article so far. I'm really grateful that I was able to take this break, without it, who knows If I would've been able to really step back and make the correct choices.

There were a bunch of things that I reflected on from my time as an intern. A lot of those things were pieces of advice and words of wisdom that my mentor and manager had shared with me. They're both great guys and were very supportive of me, always attempting to assuage my negative feelings whenever I brought it up to them. My problem was that I didn't listen very well, I was too wrapped up in what I felt.

One of the major points that they made to me that I simply didn't grasp until I left is that Junior developers, just like Senior developers, have an inherent value.

The thing is, is that the value Junior developers provide is a bit more subtle. Instead of having value through code and big decisions, you have value by partaking in the team building and knowledge sharing process. This is a sort of back and forth process that will go on between you and your team members. They'll build you up, and in turn, you'll build them up. This may be a little less exciting depending on what you're into (I know it was for me at first), but it's just as important as code.

So, what can you do to make this back and forth process go as well as possible for everyone involved?

## The Perspective

I think that the most valuable thing that you can do as a junior developer is to show up, be engaged and be yourself. That's it. That may not sound like much, but the things that happen when you're engaged can be truly benficial to the team and the project your working on as a whole.

The first thing that you bring to the table when you're engaged is a fresh perspective. When you're in any industry for a significant period of time, it's pretty easy to get cynical. This cynicism definetily has value, but it can get can in the way of potential improvements to your team's software if it becomes a ubiquitous mindset. An experienced, more cynical developer may be less willing to do experimental work because they had a prior negative experience, but as a new developer, you don't have the baggage of those experiences. You're in the perfect position to provide a balance in the overall mindset of your team.

Maybe the senior developers on team won't want to spend time looking at something that may or may not work, but you can! Who better? It's pretty hard to waste the time of a new developer. Worst case scenario, you learn something new! Best case scenario, you introduce something to your project that probably wouldn't have made it in if you weren't there to get the work done. So really, as a junior dev, you have the unique opportunity to keep your team flexible and even innovative.

With your fresh perspective, you're also going to be in a great position to challenge the status quo of your team. The most effective way that you can do this and affect change is simply by asking, 'Why?'

Asking why things are done in certain ways or why certain technologies are used over others can be really hard questions to answer. Most of the time, things are done for very good, specific reasons. Most of the time. Sometimes, the reasons are not so obvious, and they may not be so obvious to the people on your team either. There's a solid chance that there are some things that your team does that are less than ideal but they just continue doing things that way because it's how they've always been done. Now, no one really wants to do something that is less than ideal, so asking 'Why?' can be a great way to call attention to a potential area of improvement. 

Another thing that I think is incredibly useful for your team is participating in code review. Reviewing the code of other devs, particularly very high level devs, as a junior can be pretty scary, but you should be doing it regardless. Worst comes to worst, you can ask some questions if you don't understand something and gain some knowledge. In the best case, you can actually significantly increase the quality of your codebase.

Simplicity is really important in a codebase. At the very least, it's important that everyone on the team is able to understand the code. By your very nature, you will keep senior devs who write crazy, over-engineered code in check, because by inserting yourself into the review process, they need to write the code in a way that the least experienced person is able to read it. Not only are you doing yourself a favor, but your doing everyone else on your team a favor by simplifying it for them as well.

In fact, you're doing even more than that, you're making the codebase for everyone who is ever going to look at that code in the future, because eventually, some other team may have to maintain it, and they'll be far happier to see code that you were able to understand rather than code that only the senior devs could decipher.

Seriously, do code reviews. I didn't do nearly enough of them during my internship out of fear but this was a mistake. Don't be afraid. 

## The Questions

This sort of comes as a result of having a fresh perspective, but often, junior developers end up challenging the status quo of their team. There are a couple of ways that 

///

Immediately I noticed that the start of my full-time work was completely different from the start of my first real experience, which was as an intern last summer. The project was different, a couple of the people were different, but for the most part, the difference mostly stemmed from me and how I felt about myself as an employee and a team member.

This is a story about how I completely undervalued myself as a Junior Developer, and why you should avoid thinking that way that I did at all costs.

Nagivating your first job in tech is hard. There's just so much to learn and it can be really overwhelming for the first couple of months. Especially in a field like web development where the sheer number of different technologies out there can be tiring even to experienced developers.

Navigating your first job in the tech industry is hard. One of the big reasons for this is that there's simply so much to learn. The number of things that one can learn to better their career as a Software Engineer is basically endless, there's always room to learn more. Obviously this can be incredibly overwhelming for a new developer, especially one who isn't familiar with particular technologies or processes that they're new team will be using.

I started my first job in the industry last summer as an intern, working on a React project that used Redux for state management. I was a complete beginner when it came to web development. I barely knew what the DOM was, let alone fully understanding the fundementals of a library like React. Despite my lack of knowledge of the platform that my team was working in, I desperately wanted to provide value and make a real impact on my project during the short period of time that I had at the company. I thought that if I could accomplish this, I would be making a great impression and securing a full time job offer for the following year.

I soon learned that this wouldn't be easy. For most of the first month of my internship, I would come into work and I would have to pair with someone because at first, I couldn't pick up most tickets without getting a bit of help. I had no idea what was being discussed during meetings half the time, and I felt like I knew so little that I couldn't even formulate a question that wouldn't completely derail the meeting that I was in. I felt like I was just absorbing resources and not giving the team anything back in return. I hated this feeling. I didn't like not knowing things, I didn't like the feeling of being a burden to my more productive teammates. I wanted to help, I wanted to contribute. (visible, measurable way)

The thing is, is that I was contributing, I just didn't see it at the time because I was looking at the wrong things.

How could I do that, though? React was clearly the backbone of our project, but learning it to a sufficient degree in order to be truly productive and impactful seemed almost impossible given my time restraints. So, I decided to find other areas in which I could be impactful. Redux seemed significantly more approachable to me. It's a small library with only a couple of fundemental concepts, and we relied upon it heavily in our codebase. Almost too heavily I would say looking back on it, but of course I had no clue at the time.

So instead of making the wise, long term decision of spending my free time during those three monthes becoming more proficient at React and the Web generally, I simply learned enough so that I could get by and put the rest of my effort into learning Redux so that I could be immediately productive in the context of my less-than-ideal codebase. I wasn't a React developer, I was a react-redux developer. Now, there's nothing wrong with a developer that leverages both React and Redux effectively, but I was a developer that was using Redux as a crutch to compensate for a lack of React knowledge, and this meant that I was doomed to utilize both innefectively.

That's why this was such a mistake. Sure, I was productive, but at what cost? Most of the code that I pushed out was alright, but I definetily pushed out some crap that I'm not longer proud of. Crap that I probably wouldn't have contributed if I hadn't been looking to solve problems in our code that didn't really exist. On top of that, I ended up stunting my growth as a developer by ignoring the fundementals of the technologies that my team relied on. By doing this, I reduced my ability to be useful to my team in the long run. Luckily, I was an intern, so after the summer I had a full year to reflect and correct the course of my learning. If I hadn't had that break I probably would've had to learn my lesson in a less pleasant way.

So, how did I come to the realization that my mindset was completely out of whack? Well, I finally began to listen to what the people around me were saying. I had a fantastic mentor during my internship, and occasionally, I would bring my feelings up to him. He would attempt to explain to me that I was in fact, contributing, albiet indirectly, but his answers never made me feel any more comfortable until I had left. Turns out, he was right, so I'm going to attempt to impart some of his wisdom here.

The most important thing that I learned from him is that junior developers are just as valuable as anyone other developer, albiet for very different reasons. Will you make some crazy code contribution that revolutionizes the codebase? Will you make some large-scale architectural decision that makes your project significantly more maintainable? Will you implement some new feature that increases profits by who knows how much? Probably not, at least for a little while. And that's okay. Really, it's okay. In fact, it's actually better than okay that there are people on the team that aren't able to make those kind of contributes yet. Yet is the key word there. One day, you will no longer be a junior dev, and this will in large part be due to the things that you learn on the job from your peers.

This collection of feelings really bothered me during my internship. I felt like I was a complete burden to my team, or more accurately, a parasite. From my perspective, I was just absorbing knowledge and resources from my team on a daily basis without providing anything useful to them in return.
