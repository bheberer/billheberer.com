When I was learning React, I feared the Component model. I had no idea what the hell 'unidirectional data flow' meant and I barely understood fundemental concepts like `Lifting State Up`. This proved to be a problem for me as I started to become more interested in Front-End development. When I started my first job in the industry as an intern last summer, I was working on a React project that used Redux for state management. Looking back on it, I'm not entirely sure that we were using Redux in an effective way. Our codebase was littered with Redux code, and to my untrained eye, it seemed as though Redux was just as, if not more important than React itself. I was perfectly content with this, as someone who feared the component model at the time. One might expect someone new to a React job would spend the majority of their time learning React, but this wasn't the case for me. I did spend some time with React of course, enough to get my feet wet and do well on the job, but I spent far more of my personal time learning about Redux. I wasn't a React developer last summer, I was a react-redux developer. The component model can be scary, and training yourself to think in React can be a challenge, but ultimately it'll be worthwhile for you as a developer.

This focus on Redux, coupled with my lack of understanding of React was bad for a couple of reasons, one being personal and one being organizational. Personally, it meant that I was unintentionally stunting my growth as a developer and forcing myself to use Redux as a crutch. As an example, let's talk about a personal project of mine that I started that summer. I wanted to build a simple scheduling application to help students that went to my University. I saw it as a great opportunity to learn React outside of the office setting, and I went into the project with the intention of not using Redux. This was a good goal, looking back on it, but I didn't stick with it. I started to struggle almost immediately, which is not uncommon for someone learning React. I really did try to write it without reaching for Redux, but I wanted to complete the project more than I wanted to be disciplined, and I gave in. Eventually, all of my state ended up int he Redux store. All of it.

There are numerous technical reasons why one should not put all of their state into Redux, but those really aren't why this situation ended up being a negative one. The real offense here is that I allowed myself to subvert the component model without fully understanding it. State management tools how their place in production, but for the most part, they completely circumvent or avoid concepts that make React, React. As I just stated, Redux allows you to completely avoid having to think about your state in terms of your component tree. Mobx allows you to ignore the immutable nature of React state, and so on. Now, these are great tools that have their place in production, but I think that they can be a dangerous temptation for newer developers, I know they were for me. When you subvert the component model without truly understanding it, you will end up stunting your growth as a React developer and you will become too reliant on third party solutions. This means that you'll reach for these tools when they probably aren't needed, and your codebase will suffer negatively as a result. Orgazationally, you will start with one react-redux developer, who may or may take the time to learn the fundementals. If they do not, then inevitably they will bring up another generation of react-redux developers, and on and on it will go.

Now, I'm not saying to not use Redux, but I am saying that if you're a new developer, it is increidbly worthwhile to take the time to learn to think about state as it maps to your React components. Basically, you should learn React. It feels so, so nice to be completely comfortable in a codebase and to be confidant that you can make a significant change or refactor without reaching for a crutch. Now, learning React is pretty tough, which is why I avoided it for as long as I did, but now I'd like to think I know a thing or two, and I want to help you out, so let's get started!
